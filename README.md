# Deep-Unsupervised-Fashion-Image-Clustering-Using-Siamese-Networks-and-Gaussian-Mixture-Models
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning pipeline for unsupervised clustering of fashion images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The project leverages Siamese Networks to learn discriminative embeddings by comparing image pairs and then applies Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to cluster these embeddings probabilistically.

Features
1. Contrastive embedding learning using Siamese networks for improved representation of fashion images.

2. Probabilistic clustering via Gaussian Mixture Models to handle overlapping and complex cluster shapes.

3. Fully unsupervised pipeline requiring no labeled data for clustering.

4. Evaluation of clustering quality using metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and clustering accuracy.

5. Visualization of learned clusters using t-SNE.
